# -ONLINE-VOTING-SYSTEM-USING-PYTHON
This Python program is designed to simulate a simple election system where two candidates compete in an election, and voters can cast their votes based on their voter IDs. The system ensures that only registered voters are allowed to vote, and each voter can only vote once. The program collects votes, counts them, and displays the final election results at the end of the process. The election continues until all registered voters have cast their votes, after which the winner is determined based on the candidate with the most votes.

The election process begins with the program prompting the user to input the names of two candidates running for the election. These candidates will then be presented as choices for the voters. In the next step, a list of registered voters is provided, with each voter having a unique voter ID. The system ensures that only voters with valid IDs are eligible to cast their votes. The total number of registered voters is displayed for transparency, allowing users to see how many individuals are eligible to vote.

The voting process is managed through a loop that continuously asks for the voter’s ID until all voters have cast their votes. Each voter is required to enter their voter ID, and the system checks if they have already voted or if their ID is valid. If the voter has already cast their vote, a message is displayed notifying them that they cannot vote again. If the ID is valid and the voter has not voted yet, the system presents the voter with two options: one for each of the two candidates. The voter selects one of the candidates, and the program increments the vote count for the selected candidate. The system then removes the voter’s ID from the list of eligible voters to prevent them from voting again and adds their ID to a "voted" list to keep track of those who have already participated.

The program also includes input validation to handle incorrect inputs. If a voter enters an invalid voter ID or makes an invalid choice when voting (i.e., selecting an option other than 1 or 2), the system will inform them and prompt them again for correct input. This ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience for the voters.

Once all registered voters have participated and the voter list is empty, the voting process is concluded, and the program displays the result. If one candidate has received more votes than the other, the candidate with the higher number of votes is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the program announces that the election resulted in a tie. The system ensures that the election process is transparent, allowing users to see the number of voters and the final vote tally before announcing the result.

This election simulation program offers a straightforward, easy-to-understand example of how voting systems work. It introduces basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and lists in Python, and demonstrates how these elements can be used to create a functional, interactive application. The program can be extended or adapted to simulate more complex election systems with additional features, such as multiple candidates, a larger voter pool, and more detailed input validation. Overall, this program serves as a foundational example of how a voting system can be implemented using Python.
